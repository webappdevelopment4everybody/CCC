                    <p>Questions to Ask Elderly Home Care Agencies Ideally a home care agency becomes a family's trusted partner for senior care. When you meet with the administrator, getting answers to the following questions can help you avoid choosing
                        a mismatch or substandard care. What is the administrator's background? Ask the question in a friendly getting-to-know-you manner. All sorts of people direct home care agencies, and some are more qualified than others! A director's
                        duties are important and diverse: setting the agency's policies, managing the employees, negotiating with insurance companies, ensuring compliance with healthcare laws, and more. Many states require that two people serve as an
                        agency's administrators. The most appropriate educational background for a home care agency leader is in healthcare administration or public health. Typically an administrator has a master's degree, but competence for the role
                        is certainly possible with a bachelor's degree plus work experience. Longtime healthcare professionals such as RNs and psychologists also move into administrative positions. The best home care agencies are led by people with relevant
                        training and a genuine commitment to human well-being. If you get the sense that money is the manager's main motivator, then it's time to wiggle out of the interview. Is the agency Medicare certified? To receive Medicare coverage
                        for home care, a patient needs to work with a Medicare Certified Home Health Agency (CHHA). Is the agency licensed by the state? Not all states have industry-specific licenses for home care agencies. .</p>

                    <p>Types of Home Care Agencies As mentioned above, home care agencies will be slightly more expensive than private hires. So what exactly are home care agencies and are they worth the extra cost? Below, we'll take a closer look at the
                        different types of agencies and questions to ask when choosing one. Home care agencies in the US fall into four main categories. Comparing the categories, you'll see they vary in terms of licensing, services and accepted payments.
                        Categories: Medicare Certified Home Health Agencies State Licensed Home Health Agencies Non-Medical Care Agencies Home Care Employment Agencies Medicare Certified Home Health Agencies (CHHAs) Medicare is the USA's federal health
                        insurance program for adults 65 and older. It also insures younger adults with kidney disease and children with disabilities. When Medicare patients receive home care, Medicare will only pay if a Certified Home Health Agency (CHHA)
                        provides the services. Agencies eligible for certification provide skilled nursing and at least one therapy. Each Medicare Certified Home Health Agency directly employs skilled nurses. (Direct employment means that the work isn't
                        subcontracted.) </p>

                    <h5>Nunc Eu Ullamcorper Orci</h5>
                    <p>If your state has the option, choose a state licensed home care agency for assurance that state standards are met. Does the agency carry insurance? Choose an agency that has its caregivers bonded and insured. A well-run agency also
                        has professional liability insurance and general liability insurance. What services are available? Home care agencies may provide medical services, non-medical services or both. Confirm that the desired services are available.
                        For example, not every state-licensed center has an RN on call 24/7. Some, but not all, have caregivers trained in speech therapy, physical therapy, Alzheimer's therapy or memory care, and other healthcare specialties. </p>

                    <p>States that license their home care agencies may have more than one type of license available. The biggest distinction is whether a license approves medical care or non-medical care. Many home care agencies hold multiple licenses in
                        order to offer a wide range of home care services. Because each state sets its own standards, the laws governing home care agencies are quite different from place to place. Some states have rigorous licensing standards for home
                        care agencies.

                        have specific experience in healthcare management. Some states have easy-to-meet licensing standards. It's important to know that states sometimes grant licenses based solely on paper applications. This lets new agencies run for
                        several months or longer before the facilities are actually inspected by the government. A minority of states lack industry-specific licenses. At last check the list included:</p>

                    <p>How are the caregivers trained? The best home care agencies have extensive orientations for caregivers and provide continuing education. One essential part of caregiving is effectively handling emergencies, so be sure to ask if emergency
                        training is included in employee orientation. (Are employees trained in fire safety? Do they know the Heimlich maneuver and CPR?) Continuing education lets caregivers build their healthcare skill sets and stay up-to-date with best
                        practices in home care. How thorough are the agency's background checks? Effectively vetting a potential employee involves talking with their previous employer and other references. It also involves getting a full criminal background
                        check to be aware of any felonies, misdemeanors and driving violations. How many caregivers are assigned to each client? The best home care agencies assign more than one caregiver to each client. Because two or three people become
                        regular visitors, a worker familiar to the senior is available even if one person takes time off or leaves the agency. If the senior is unhappy with a caregiver, can another worker take the shift? You might also ask the director
                        to explain their procedure for matching clients with caregivers. How are caregivers managed? When caregivers are treated well, their patients can benefit. Before hiring a home care agency, observe how the management interacts with
                        staff. Ask the director how the agency motivates its workers and recognizes great work. Also ask about employee supervision and evaluation. Directors should occasionally observe their employees in the field — preferably unannounced
                        to help ensure quality control</p>

                        care agencies for Medicare, many state governments set agency licensing standards to help protect consumers. When states do not issue special licenses, the agencies only need standard business licenses for legal operation.</p>
